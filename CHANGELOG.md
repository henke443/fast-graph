Version 1.0.2 (2024-04-03)
==========================

- Cleaned some things up mostly and changed documentation.
- For the next version I'm planning to add more tests and making the github prettier. I will also make what I got even neater and then the version after that I aim to add more graph algorithms. After that I can start creating some benchmarks to see how much/if there is a significant speedup in some situations compared to alternatives and when that happen.
