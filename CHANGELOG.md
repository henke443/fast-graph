Version 1.1.0 (2024-04-04)
==========================
Lots of breaking changes to correct some of my own concerns and also some feedback from other people.
I will try to avoid breaking changes but there almost certainly be a few more ones. 
When I think the library is stable I will set the version to 2.0.0.

Breaking changes
----------------
- Removed SlotMapGraph
- Reduced Clone requirement
- `add_edge` now returns EdgeID.
- CategoryGraph renamed to CategorizedGraph

Version 1.0.2 (2024-04-04)
==========================

- Cleaned some things up mostly and changed documentation.
- For the next version I'm planning to add more tests and making the github prettier. I will also make what I got even neater and then the version after that I aim to add more graph algorithms. After that I can start creating some benchmarks to see how much/if there is a significant speedup in some situations compared to alternatives and when that happen.
